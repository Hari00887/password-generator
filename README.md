Password Generator
A simple and customizable Password Generator built using Python's tkinter library to create secure passwords based on user-defined criteria. This project offers an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) where users can set the length of the password and choose whether to allow character repetition.

Features
Customizable Password Length: Define the desired length of the password (within limits of available characters).
Character Repetition: Option to allow or disallow character repetition in the generated password.
Diverse Character Set: Includes uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters to enhance password security.
GUI Interface: A simple and easy-to-use graphical interface powered by tkinter.
Error Handling: Alerts users if inputs are invalid or exceed character limits.

Code Overview
The core logic is in the generate_password() function which:

Takes user inputs for length and repetition.
Generates a password based on user preferences using Python's random module:
If repetition is allowed: random.choices().
If repetition is not allowed: random.sample().
Displays the password in a read-only entry box within the GUI.
